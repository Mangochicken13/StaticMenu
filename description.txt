This is a mod that adds a custom menu, which "disables" the day-night cycle by forcing it to remain night at all times.

This mod was made to hopefully help with player accessibility, by stopping the background from changes colours while in most default menus.

If you have any questions or queries please reach out to me @mangochicken_ on discord.


Now for some keywords so people can search for some extra words and find this (at least hopefully)
